An unfortunate consequence has been the advent of predatory publishing, which exploits the open-access model for monetary gain by collecting publishing fees from authors under the pretense of being a legitimate publication while providing little-to-no peer review. This study aims to investigate the predatory publishing phenomenon in orthopaedic literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Beall’s List of Predatory Journals and Publishers and another list of predatory journals for journal titles that are possibly related to orthopaedics. We then searched their web sites for the following information: total number of articles published, journal country of origin, author country of origin, article processing charge (APC), quoted review time, and location of the listed headquarters. We also reported the article quality of a random sample of these journals. We consulted InCites Journal Citation Reports to determine the number of nonpredatory orthopaedic publications that are indexed, and we manually searched a random sample of these legitimate journals for Beall’s criteria. Additionally, we searched the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and PubMed databases for any possible predatory journal titles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 104 suspected predatory publishers, representing 225 possible predatory journals. One journal was indexed in the DOAJ, and 20 were indexed in PubMed. Review time was not identified for 56.2% of the journals, and 36.5% quoted a review time of &lt;1 month. Nearly half of the listed addresses of the publishers were either unsearchable or led to residential or empty lots. Eighty-two legitimate journals were identified. The median APC was $420 for predatory journals and $2,900 for legitimate journals. We found that a random sample of the legitimate journals published studies with higher reporting standards, but a few also contained 1 criterion that is found on Beall’s list.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study highlights the scope of orthopaedic predatory publishing. Possibly predatory journals outnumber legitimate orthopaedic journals. Orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the suspected predatory journals and consult available online tools to identify them because distinguishing them from legitimate journals can be a challenge.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="48"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>STATUS</meta-name><meta-value>ONLINE-ONLY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>There has been a substantial change in the academic publishing industry with the growth of the Internet. It has allowed for greater volumes of publication and expanded journal distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>. However, over the last 20 years, the increasing costs have led to the development of the open-access (OA) movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>, which sought to make published literature more accessible and relied on fees from authors and institutions. Predatory journals started to emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>, and capitalized on the ever-increasing pressure that is placed on researchers to publish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>The term “predatory journals,” which is defined as journals from counterfeit publishers that exploit the OA model to extract fees from authors, was coined by librarian Jeffrey Beall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2 bib3">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup>. The publishers defraud using the OA model by failing to conduct legitimate peer review and lacking editorial transparency while soliciting fees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>. In recent years, the growth of predatory journals has been exponential, and they threaten legitimate research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>. Beall curated a database of “potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers,” which served as the main record for this problem; however, his web site was taken down suddenly and unexpectedly in early 2017. The most up-to-date version of Beall’s list is archived online<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>Journals and publishers are identified as potentially or borderline predatory when they fit specific criteria. Beall’s criteria of &gt;50 qualities of predatory journals were made public after initial criticisms of the list had been made privately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup>. Other authors also have shared their own criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup>. Currently, there is no universally accepted guide; in general, predatory journals are said to have common traits, including promised short review times, an overly broad scope, aggressive e-mail and other forms of author solicitation, little-to-no peer review, editorial boards that are composed of academics without their prior knowledge or with falsified qualifications, journal titles that are similar to other preexisting journals, unprofessionally designed web sites and e-mails with grammatical and spelling errors, falsified or misrepresented contact addresses that are listed as their locations, poor journal practice standards, falsification or lack of listed impact factors, and lack of transparency on authorship or article processing charges (APCs).</p><p>According to some recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>, predatory journals frequently are found in biomedical research and are pervasive in developed countries and in low and middle-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, no study has fully explored this phenomenon in the orthopaedic literature, although a 2014 study did raise this concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup>. The aims of our study were (1) to determine the prevalence of suspected predatory journals within the orthopaedic literature, (2) to identify common characteristics of suspected orthopaedic predatory journals in comparison with indexed legitimate journals, and (3) to determine if these publications are indexed in legitimate databases.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Database Search</title><p>A manual search of an archived version of Beall’s List of Predatory Journals and Publishers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> and another independent list of predatory journals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> (accessed June 2017) was performed independently by 3 of our authors (L.-P.B., J.R.Y., and J.R.L.). Journals and publishers were listed if they fit Beall’s criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Keyword search terms included arthro*, bone, hip, joint, knee, musculoskeletal, ortho*, spine, and sport*. We based our methodology on previously described strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>. Journal titles containing these keywords were retained, and 3 of our authors (H.B., G.S., and J.R.L.) independently pulled data from the web sites. Discrepancies were handled by consensus with a senior author. We manually searched and reviewed the available web sites of the orthopaedic journal titles that were identified on Beall’s list, and compiled a list of criteria for “predatory” or “possibly predatory” journals according to Beall’s criteria.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE I</label><caption><p>Beall’s Criteria for Screening Possible,

Another issue is that the journal advertises that there is “no article processing charge,” but also offers an author portal tool for fee and invoice requests, which was confusing at the very least. The final, and most suspicious, point was noted by our senior author, who discovered that a colleague was listed on the board of editors but was unaware of being involved with that particular journal and actually had no role with it. The DOAJ has recently implemented stricter inclusion requirements for indexing journals after hundreds of questionable journals on Beall’s list were found on its database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup>. Its current vetting criteria now include &gt;50 requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup>. PubMed and MEDLINE’s vetting process is led by the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee, a federal advisory committee, which evaluates a journal’s quality of editorial work, review process, ethical guidelines, disclosure of financial conflicts of interests, and conformance to other scholarly publishing best-practices guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup>. However, it has been attested that PubMed’s process can be circumvented: after submitting publications to PubMed Central, a publisher obtains an identifying number and then becomes listed in the database. This has raised concern for more rigorous screening criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>Twenty possible predatory journal titles were found indexed on PubMed. For each title, a manual search through that journal’s web site as well as a general online search of the journal’s and publisher’s name were conducted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>). Each of these journals had concerning characteristics or belonged to publishers with suspicious findings. The most common qualities that were found were inaccurate or vague address locations, a history of excessive spam e-mails, poor-quality web sites with broken links, unsecure pages, or multiple grammatical and/or spelling errors; in addition, they offered express or premium services for additional fees. Several of the journals were found to be part of publishing companies that had been caught printing hoax papers during investigative sting operations.</p><p>Searching through the random sample of indexed legitimate journals, we found 3 whose web sites had information that fit Beall’s criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table IV</xref>). One journal was flagged because of “little or no geographic diversity among the editorial” board; however, on further investigation, we found that the title indicates an official national journal, which would mean its editorial scope would have a tight national focus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup>. Two were flagged for having only listed 1 editor on its board, which fits Beall’s criteria of having an “insufficient number” of editors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup>. However, additional examination of the articles found that many guest editors were listed along with the single consulting editor. Even though these criteria were noted, we did not find any other traces of predatory or suspicious practices in these journals; therefore, these criteria, in isolation, should not be condemning. However, this does highlight the risk that these criteria represent for inadvertently mislabeling a journal as predatory.</p><p>The APC was mentioned for 68.6% of the suspected journals, with a median of $420 USD (IQR, $269 to $1,027). This is less than the median for the legitimate journals ($2,900 USD) and the industry average: previous research has demonstrated costs of $4,871 for print and online access only, $3,509 for subscription online only, and $2,289 for OA online only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup>. Two studies by Manca et al. had similar findings: predatory rehabilitation journals had average APCs of $751 compared with $1,103 for nonpredatory journals, and predatory neuroscience journals had APCs that ranged from $521 to $637 compared with $1,000 for nonpredatory journals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>. Shamseer et al. found predatory journals charging median APCs ($100) that were lower than those of nonpredatory journals ($1,866)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup>. Lower APCs are thought to lure more potential researchers, which provides greater revenue for the journals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>The advertised time to review also was analyzed and was listed to be &lt;1 month for 36.5% of the predatory orthopaedic journals. The majority (56.2%) did not specify review time. The median time to review for those that did specify it was 3 weeks (IQR, 2 to 4 weeks), which is lower than the industry average of approximately 14.3 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>. Some journals advertised peer review within days from when a manuscript is submitted. In our investigation, we found journals that advertised a review time as low as 7 days.</p><p>The most prevalent countries of origin for the predatory journals were India, the United States, and the U.K. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, many of the predatory journals listed &gt;1 office location: often, the first office that is listed is located in a high-income country, and a second location is in a less-developed nation, perhaps to be more appealing to potential authors. Most authors were from India, the United States, the U.K., and Japan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). There may be an increased pressure for scholars in those countries to publish because academic publishing is linked to financial incentives or may be required for career advancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20 bib21 bib22">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup>. This drive has led to increased submissions, which begets more rejections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>. This pressure has been identified as a factor for research misconduct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25 bib26">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup>, and may contribute to the creation of a market for lesser-quality journals, some of which may be predatory, with less-stringent review processes for printing articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>. Using a random sample of predatory journals and indexed legitimate journals, our study found that fewer randomized controlled trials and no meta-analyses were published in the predatory sample. The CONSORT scores were lower for the randomized controlled trials found in the predatory journal sample than for any of the randomized controlled trials found among the indexed journals (median score of 6.5 versus 23.75 of 25, respectively).</p><p>Investigating the listed locations of a randomly selected sample of suspected predatory journals revealed that there are questionable office addresses. Many of the locations were empty, were residential homes, or were unsearchable. This is consistent with other studies that demonstrate that listing false addresses or not listing a physical address are unethical business practices of predatory journals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup>. One study reported a rate of nearly 25% for addresses that were vague or impossible to determine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup>, compared with our rate of 20.8%.</p><p>Reports show that predatory journals have failed to meet the international standards for publication, and there are many red flags, including poor peer-review processes, fake editors, plagiarism, articles that may have questionable results that are unable to be verified accurately or be reproduced, ethical misconduct, and unclear methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup>. On other occasions, papers have been published in predatory journals describing experiments that have not been conducted, and authorship of prewritten papers has been sold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>. The damage of such actions to the scientific process and the community is serious and could potentially adversely affect the quality of orthopaedic research.</p><sec><title>Study Limitations</title><p>The limitations of this paper are tied to the sources of data that we searched. Our data came from the last version of Beall’s list in early 2017 (before the web site was taken down) and another anonymous web site that had been inspired by Beall’s work. Beall’s list, although well-known and extensive, was not validated before its deletion, and was initially criticized for lack of transparency on how it applied its criteria and for being unavailable for reproducibility. There was concern that there may have been unfair listings of legitimate journals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup>. Some of the criteria can be broadly overapplied, and therefore are not specifically limited to just predatory journals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table IV</xref>). Recently, another company developed a blacklist of untrusted journals, but there is limited accessibility to this list because of its industry-level pricing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup>. Given the competing risks of missing questionable journals and of mislabeling legitimate journals as predatory, future research should design and validate tools and criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Directions and Recommendations</title><p>The scientific community needs to increase awareness of how to identify and avoid predatory journals. This is especially important for junior researchers because 65% of their publications are by first-time authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup>; many have recounted being lured by the promise of quick publication, only to regret it after being hounded for additional publication fees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup>. The poor publication practices of predatory journals also could affect clinical care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>. Criteria previously identified to reveal possible predatory journals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> include low APCs; spelling and grammatical errors on web sites; an overly broad scope; language that targets authors rather than readers; promises of rapid publication (for additional fees); and a lack of information about retraction policies, copyright, manuscript handling, or digital preservation. Our study found that suspected predatory orthopaedic journals share these characteristics; they also named unaware physicians as serving on editorial boards and listed illegitimate headquarter addresses.</p><p>We recommend that research and funding organizations track possible predatory orthopaedic journals to further limit the spread of these journals. Use of the “think-check-submit” strategy when searching for a journal to publish one’s work is encouraged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup>. Other tips include checking the journal title against the DOAJ (which serves as a white list), ensuring that the editorial board includes recognizable and trustworthy researchers, and evaluating the journal for any of the aforementioned predatory traits. Finally, novel journal evaluation tools that help to assess for possible predatory journals are being developed, although validation is ongoing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup>. Current and future orthopaedic physicians and academics need to be aware of the phenomenon of predatory publishing and take active measures to limit its spread.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1"><p><bold>Disclosure:</bold> On the <bold>Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest</bold> forms,
